These are the tasks which I had done in my internship at Unified Mentor.

Task 1 - Movie Rating Prediction Model
  -  Built a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Explored data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.
  -  Employed libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model development.
  -  Implemented algorithms like Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors, achieving high predictive accuracy.

Task 2 - Iris Flower Classification Model
  - Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Trained a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
  - Developed a machine learning model to classify iris flower species using Python.Leveraged Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model training.
  - Employed algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, achieving over 0.95 accuracy.

Task 3 - Sales Prediction Model
  -  Build a model for Sales prediction which involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation and advertising platform selection.
  -  Developed a machine learning model to predict sales using Python. Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and Scikitlearn for data preprocessing and model building.
  -  Implemented algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, achieving high predictive accuracy. Gained expertise in data analysis, feature engineering, and model validation.
